* Introduction
ADW-Charting is a simple chart drawing library for quickly creating 
reasonable-looking pie charts. It presents a 
function-oriented interface similar to [[http://www.xach.com/lisp/vecto/][Vecto]], 
and saves results to PNG. Since ADW-Charting and all supporting 
libraries are written completely in Common Lisp, without 
depending on external non-Lisp libraries, it should work 
in any Common Lisp environment. ADW-Charting is available 
under a BSD-like license. The 'ADW' in the name is 
referencing my employer, [[http://www.acceleration.net][Acceleration.net]], who has 
sponsored much of this work. The current version is 0.8, 
released on August 24th, 2009.

The canonical location for ADW-Charting is http://common-lisp.net/project/adw-charting/

* Installation
ADW-Charting is not yet asdf-installable, but that is on the [[file:todo.org][todo list]].
For now, download the tarball at http://common-lisp.net/project/adw-charting/adw-charting.tar.gz
or go straight to the darcs repository located at http://common-lisp.net/project/adw-charting/darcs/adw-charting
* Sample Usage
Here are a few quick examples:
** minimal pie chart
A simple pie chart using Vecto to generate the PNG file:
*** vecto backend
#+INCLUDE "../examples/minimal-pie-chart-vecto.lisp" src lisp
[[file:minimal-pie-chart-vecto.png]]
 
*** google backend
The same pie chart using the Google Chart API to generate the PNG:
#+INCLUDE "../examples/minimal-pie-chart-google.lisp" src lisp
file:minimal-pie-chart-google.png

** minimal line chart
*** vecto backend
#+INCLUDE "../examples/minimal-line-chart-vecto.lisp" src lisp
[[file:minimal-line-chart-vecto.png]]

*** google backend
#+INCLUDE "../examples/minimal-line-chart-google.lisp" src lisp
[[file:minimal-line-chart-google.png]]

** minimal bar chart
*** vecto backend
#+INCLUDE "../examples/minimal-bar-chart-vecto.lisp" src lisp
[[file:minimal-bar-chart-vecto.png]]

*** google backend
#+INCLUDE "../examples/minimal-bar-chart-google.lisp" src lisp
[[file:minimal-bar-chart-google.png]]

** star ratings
This is a vecto-only chart:
#+INCLUDE "../examples/star-rating.lisp" src lisp
[[file:star-rating.png]]

Be sure the width is at least 5 times the height.

* Rendering Backends
ADW-Charting has two rendering backends, one using Vecto to create PNG
files directly, another using the Google Chart API to let Google
handle the drawing duties.  Each has it's pros and cons, and is
activated by loading a different .asd file.  You can use both at the
same time.  They are both actively developed (albeit at a snail's
pace).
** Vecto backend, adw-charting-vecto.asd
Pros:
- pure lisp solution, total control is available
- size and data density are only limited by computing resources 
Cons:
- conses an awful lot
- generated PNGs don't display in Microsoft image viewer, must be
  viewed via a browser (IE shows them fine)
** Google backend, adw-charting-google.asd
With this renderer, adw-charting assembles the url parameters and
makes HTTP calls (using Drakma) to Google's chart service, or can give
you the url directly.

Pros:
- much less CPU intensive
- images are served using Google's bandwidth, not yours
- simple charts frequently look better
- more chart features are available, although many aren't yet implemented in the vecto backend
Cons:
- limited to 300,000 pixels per image (which is smaller than you think)
- Google's label placement can be screwy sometimes
- requires the lisp be connected to the internet
- depends on a third party service that might be shut off tomorrow
- any sensitive information would travel to another server via http
- can't graph large datasets (all data has to be passed on the
  querystring)
** Which one should you use?
The answer is always "it depends".  I generally use the google backend
for public data, or if I want to use a chart feature that is not
implemented in the Vecto backend.  I use vecto backend for private
data, when I want a very large chart, or when I want to work
disconnected.

Eventually, I would like to improve the performance and functionality
of the vecto backend to the point that the google backend is
redundant.

* Caveats / Gotchas
#<<colors>>
- All colors are RGB, represented as a list of 3 numbers between 0 and 1, eg: =(list 1 .5 .3)=
- The bounds on a pie chart are a bit goofy, as the radius of the pie is currently only determined by the height of the chart. This means a square image will cut off the legend.
- The font used for all the text is included in the distribution, some random .ttf file pulled from the debian freefont library. You can specify the font file using the =*default-font-file*= unexported variable. I'm using a with-font macro internally that could solve this one.
- Many things should be converted to vectors.  See the [[file:todo.org][todo]] for other caveats along these lines.

* Feedback
If you have any questions, comments, bug reports, or other 
feedback regarding ADW-Charting, please [[mailto:ryan@acceleration.net][email me]].

Progress and previews are occasionally available on my blog:

* API reference
adw-charting is split into 3 .asd files:
- adw-charting.asd: covers a common based used by the backends
- adw-charting-vecto.asd: covers rendering with Vecto
- adw-charting-google.asd: covers rendering with Google

These all export functions into the adw-charting package.

In most cases, to render a chart you call some =with-*= variant to
create a chart context, call functions in that context to configure
the chart, then call a =save-*= function to perform the rendering.  Most
functions will not work if they called outside a chart context, with a
few exceptions.

** Creating a chart context
*** Vecto: with-chart
#+begin_src lisp
(defmacro with-chart ((type width height &key (background '(1 1 1))) &body body))
#+end_src
Initializes a chart.

The =type= argument is one of:
- :line - normal line chart
- :bar - normal bar chart
- :pie - normal pie chart
- :star-rating - displays a percentage as partially filled stars.  See the [[*star%20rating][star rating example]].

=width= and =height= are the dimensions of the final image in pixels.

=background= is an optional background color for the chart, defaulting to white.

**** deprecated
- =with-pie-chart=: use =(with-chart (:pie ...= 
- =with-line-chart=: use =(with-chart (:line ...=  
- =with-bar-chart=: use =(with-chart (:bar ...= 

*** Google: with-gchart 
#+begin_src lisp
(defmacro with-gchart ((type width height &key (background '(1 1 1))) &body body))
#+end_src
Initializes a chart.

The =type= argument is one of:
- :pie - normal pie chart
- :pie-3d - 3d pie chart
- :line - normal line chart
- :v-bar - bar chart with bars rising vertically
- :h-bar - bar chart with bars rising horizontally
- :v-gbar - ?
- :h-gbar - ?

=width= and =height= are the dimensions of the final image in pixels.

=background= is an optional background color for the chart, defaulting to white.

** Modifying the chart
*** pie charts

**** add-slice
#+begin_src lisp
(defun add-slice (label value &key color))
#+end_src
Adds a slice to the pie.  

=label= a string to identify this slice

=value= any number

=color= a color for this slice, see [[colors]].  A unique color will be automatically assigned.

*** bar and line charts
**** add-series
#+begin_src lisp
(defun add-series (label data &key color (mode 'default)))
#+end_src
=label= a string to identify this series

=data= a list of =(x y)= pairs

=color= a color for this slice, see [[colors]].  A unique color will be automatically assigned.

=mode= _experimental_ use =:line= on bar charts to render this series as a line instead of a bar.
**** set-axis
#+begin_src lisp
(defun set-axis (axis title &key draw-gridlines-p
		 (label-formatter #'default-label-formatter)
		 (mode :value)
		 data-interval
		 scalefn
		 draw-zero-p
		 angle))
#+end_src
=axis= which axis you'd like to configur, must be =:x= or =:y=

=title= a string used to label the axis.  nil for no axis label

=draw-gridlines-p= when non-nil, draws fairly ugly lines that match with the axis labels

=label-formatter= determines how values from your data is converted to axis labels.  You can pass this:
 1) a function of 1 argument
 2) a string to be used as the control string to a =format= call

The default tries to format values in usually acceptable way.

=draw-zero-p= if non-nil, force this axis to show 0, even if it is notcontained within the data.

=data-interval= a number that should be used as the interval whendrawing axis labels.  If nil, a suitable interval will be chosenautomatically.

=mode= _experimental_ determines how the axis values are calculated, intended be used to specify non-ordered axis values in the future.

=scalefn= _experimental_ a function used to scale data on this axis before rendering.  Currently only respected by the google backend, and I'm not sure why.

=angle= _experimental_ used to rotate axis label text
